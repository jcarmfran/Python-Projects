# Project Overview
In this project, we try to predict the future potential of NBA rookies. We'll start by scraping rookie class seasonal averages. Using BeautifulSoup, HTMLs will read in and cleaned. 
Rookie seasonal stats will be parsed into pandas DataFrames.

Feature selection will be run to identify good predictors, and train a machine learning model to make predictions. We'll end by computing rolling predictors and improving the model.

A complete end-to-end project, we plan on using web scraping, data cleaning, and machine learning to gain valuable insights and grow our understanding of building accurate forward looking prediction models.

## Project Steps

1. Scrape rookies seasonal statistics
2. Clean up HTML with Beautiful Soup
3. Parse rookie tables and build DataFrames
4. Run feature selection to identify predictors
5. Train an Machine Learning model
6. Compute rolling predictors to improve the model

## Folder overview:

* Pages - houses downloaded HTML files of rookie class
* Pictures - Folder housing 
  * annotated screengrabs
  * blog title pictures
* Spreadsheets - archived data in the form of CSVs
